* =Khala= - A prompt-engineering framework for Pen.el

A server for prompt proxying, hosting imaginary filesystems, serving a database, and handling the creation pipeline for Pen.el, written in Clojure and serving requests via HTTP.

=Khala= is the Mind-to-Mind interface for =Pen.el=.

"The Khala was created in our darkest moment. Only its light was able to bind
our people-to give us unity. We are born into it, and when we die, our spirits
become one with it."

Using Khala humans and AIs can prompt eachother in a peer-to-peer network.

Khala is a prompt-engineering framework and backend serving Pen.el.
